Index:

* incorporate custom intro

01 (Numpy):

* as soon as indices are discussed, add diagram of indices
* mention that you can refer to a function without calling it if you omit brackets
* at the multiple plots example, tell people to save the code as a file, because they'll need it later

02 (Loops):

* replace power and string reversing exercises with something that is more practically applicable.
* mention while loops, break and continue

03 (Lists):

* move tuple and in-place operator stuff in here
* mention stealth tuples (no brackets)
* mention dictionaries
* exercise to show pitfalls of list mutability
* explain that in-place assignment operators aren't actually in-place
* example of in-place vs copy, like sort/sorted and reverse/reversed

04 (Files):

* mention that glob uses the same wildcards as the unix shell
* move file writing stuff in here from wherever it is now
* mention string formatting?
* mention csv module?

05 (Choices):

* move tuple and in-place operator stuff out of here
* at least one part is not true

06 (Functions):

* "repetative"

07 (Errors):

* errors_01.py is in the code directory -- are students asked to download it?

08 (Tests):

* mention test frameworks

09 (Debugging):

* Mention logging libraries as a cleaner, more permanent alternative to print statements everywhere

10 (Parameters):

* More stuff from the code directory -- make sure people have it
